## ü§ò About <a name = "about"></a>

The intent is to create a baseline project for others to check if their setup is ready to build the react-native project using the new architecture.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Make sure your environment is set up [correctly](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
-   Verify it using npx @react-native-community/cli doctor (thanks [@truediogo](https://github.com/truediogo))
-   Make sure you have followed the [instructions](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/bundled-hermes#android-users-on-new-architecture) for successfully compiling the bundled Hermes.
-   Make sure you are using the [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt](https://reactnative.dev/docs/visual-studio-command-prompt).
-   [Download](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/tag/release-71-1) and extract the binaries of the ICU4C library.
-   Add the ICU4C folder you extracted to your PATH in the Enviroment Variables. ie: C:\icu4c\bin

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After you cloned the repository, you can run the project using the following command:

```
yarn install && yarn android
```

## ‚úÖ Changes made <a name = "changes"></a>

You can check all the changes in the [commits](https://github.com/Skullcan/reactnice/commits/master), but most important one is:

-   Added the [import](https://github.com/Skullcan/reactnice/blob/b1accfd5df286fb6b4713d1def7d56ee0fa92760/android/build.gradle#L1) and [IF](https://github.com/Skullcan/reactnice/blob/b1accfd5df286fb6b4713d1def7d56ee0fa92760/android/build.gradle#L15) in the project/build.gradle file for the NDK version 23.1.7779620. This is to prevent the error with long path files during the build process.
-   It's worth noting that for this to build in release variant I'm using this [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/34151) too in the patch-package postinstall.
